# Ethers Quick Start: 10. BigNumber and Unit Conversion

I've been re-learning `ethers.js` recently, consolidating some details, and also writing a `WTF Ethers Quick Start` for beginners.

Tip: This tutorial is based on ethers.js 6.3.0, if you are using v5, you can refer to [ethers.js v5 documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).

In this lesson, we introduce the `BigNumber` class and unit conversion.

## `BigInt`

In Ethereum, many calculations exceed the safe value of JavaScript integers (the maximum safe integer in js is `9007199254740991`). Therefore, `ethers.js` uses the native `BigInt` class of JavaScript ES2020 version to safely perform mathematical operations on numbers of any magnitude. In `ethers.js`, most operations that require returning values will return `BigInt`, and parameters that accept values will also accept them.

### Create `BigInt` instance

You can use the `ethers.getBigInt()` function to convert types such as `string`, `number`, etc. to `BigInt`.

**Note** that numbers exceeding the maximum safe integer in js will not be converted.

```js
const oneGwei = ethers.getBigInt("1000000000"); // generate from decimal string
console.log(oneGwei)
console.log(ethers.getBigInt("0x3b9aca00")) // generate from hex string
console.log(ethers.getBigInt(1000000000)) // generate from number
// Cannot generate BigNumber from numbers outside of js's largest safe integer, the following code will throw an error
// ethers.getBigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
console.log("Maximum safe integer in jsï¼š", Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
```
