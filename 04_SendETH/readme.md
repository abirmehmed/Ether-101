# Ethers Quick Start: 4. Send ETH
I've been re-learning `ethers.js` recently, consolidating some details, and also writing a `WTF Ethers Quick Start` for beginners.

In this lecture, we will introduce the `Signer` signer class and its derived `Wallet` wallet class, and use it to send `ETH`.

## `Signer` signer class

`Web3.js` assumes that users will deploy an Ethereum node locally, and the private key and network connection status are managed by this node (actually not the case); while in `ethers.js`, the `Provider` provider class manages the network connection status, and the `Signer` signer class or `Wallet` wallet class manages the keys, which is secure and flexible.

In `ethers`, the `Signer` signer class is an abstraction of an Ethereum account that can be used to sign messages and transactions, and send signed transactions to the Ethereum network, changing the blockchain state. The `Signer` class is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly. We need to use its subclass: the `Wallet` wallet class.

## `Wallet` wallet class

The `Wallet` class inherits from the `Signer` class, and developers can use it to sign transactions and messages like an externally owned account (`EOA`) that contains a private key.

Below we introduce a few ways to create a `Wallet` instance:

### Method 1: Create a random wallet object

We can use the `ethers.Wallet.createRandom()` function to create a `Wallet` object with a random private key. The private key is generated by a cryptographically secure entropy source. If there is no secure entropy source in the current environment, an error will be thrown (this method cannot be used on the online platform `playcode`).

```javascript
// Create a random wallet object
const wallet1 = new ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
```

### Method 2: Create a wallet object with a private key
If we know the private key, we can use the `ethers.Wallet()` function to create a `Wallet` object.
