Sure, I can try to write a readme.md for an ethers.js tutorial. Here is a possible example:

# Ethers.js Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v6/) library to interact with the Ethereum network. Ethers.js is a lightweight and modular library for working with Ethereum smart contracts, wallets, providers and more.

## What will you learn?

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Connect to the Ethereum network using different providers
- Create and manage Ethereum wallets and accounts
- Send and receive ether and tokens
- Deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Listen and filter events and logs
- Sign and verify messages and transactions
- Use advanced features like Flashbots, EIP-712 and more

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine
- An [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and API key
- A code editor of your choice (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## How to start?

To start this tutorial, you need to clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abirmehmed/Ether-101.git
cd ethers-js-tutorial
npm install # or yarn install
```

Then, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Alchemy API key:

```bash
ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key-here
```

You can also add other environment variables like your private key or mnemonic phrase if you want to use them in the tutorial.

The tutorial is divided into several chapters, each with its own folder and files. You can find the instructions and code snippets for each chapter in the `README.md` file inside each folder. You can also find the complete code for each chapter in the `index.js` file inside each folder.

To run the code for each chapter, you can use this command:

```bash
node chapter-number/index.js # e.g. node 01-provider/index.js
```

You can also use an online editor like [playcode.io](https://playcode.io/) or [replit.com](https://replit.com/) to run the code in your browser. However, you need to import ethers.js library from a CDN (content delivery network) link instead of installing it locally. You can use this link:

```javascript
import { ethers } from "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ethers/6.2.3/ethers.js";
```

You also need to replace the Alchemy mainnet URL with your own API key.

## What are the chapters?

The chapters of this tutorial are:

- Chapter 1: Provider - How to connect to the Ethereum network using different providers
- Chapter 2: Wallet - How to create and manage Ethereum wallets and accounts
- Chapter 3: Transaction - How to send and receive ether and tokens
- Chapter 4: Contract - How to deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Chapter 5: Event - How to listen and filter events and logs
- Chapter 6: Signature - How to sign and verify messages and transactions
- Chapter 7: Flashbots - How to use Flashbots to avoid paying gas fees and front-run transactions
- Chapter 8: EIP-712 - How to use EIP-712 to sign structured data

## Where to go next?

Congratulations! You have completed the ethers.js tutorial. You have learned how to use ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum network. You have also learned some advanced features like Flashbots and EIP-712.
