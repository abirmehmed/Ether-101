Tip: This tutorial is based on ethers.js 6.3.0, if you are using v5, you can refer to [ethers.js v5 documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).

In this lecture, we will introduce how to use `ethers.js` to read events emitted by smart contracts. If you are not familiar with `Solidity` events, you can read WTF Solidity Quick Tutorial [Lecture 12: Events](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity/blob/main/12_Event/readme.md).

For more details, please refer to [ethers.js documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/contract/#ContractEvent).
