# Ethereum Provider Examples

This code snippet provides examples of how to connect to Ethereum networks using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), a JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```sh
npm install ethers
```

## Usage

To run the code, execute:

```sh
node index.js
```

This will output several examples of how to interact with an Ethereum network using ethers, including:

- Querying the ETH balance of an address on the Ethereum mainnet and Goerli testnet
- Querying the current network that a provider is connected to
- Querying the current block number
- Querying the transaction count of an address
- Querying the current recommended gas settings
- Querying information about a specific block
- Querying the bytecode of a smart contract given its address
